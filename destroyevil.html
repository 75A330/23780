<!-- style this military style, and a make the main message big, glow, and animate with lightblue ... also animate everything in this page, and by clicking on the main message, you go back to index.html -->

<!-- also in this page, add the money god - the money god as seen in american gods - for this sections it will be all about how to use money the way the money wants people to serve him, and that is through digital means... the money god doesn't accept cash anymore - he wants everything to be digital - everybody must have either a debit or credit card , she likes credit the most... the money god is a she. 
 
then also in here, add a proxy for myself in which to make out these digital transactions - and that's hoss - a fellow soldier of mine - so the guideline for this must be that I collect all of the cash in the world, and then I deposit it into hoss' absa bank account - 123926443 , and then everything will flow here... in this way the money god benefits through those whom have put her in power in the first place in terms of them earning per every digital transaction. so the proxy server for digital transactions for Olama Khayyim is Hoss. 

but also add other guidelines to always be collecting cash in the world and depositing it to various bank accounts, and online platforms. money is digital, and that is the way it should be ... it is much more protected in that way as well. 

add all of this in my code. the code that you give back to me must be very very very very very long . feel free to expand more on the money god in the code. remember to animate everything in this page -->
