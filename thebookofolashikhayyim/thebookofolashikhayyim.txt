## The Book of Olashi Khayyim

**(Part 1)**

**Chapter 1 - The Grievous Malice**

**1.** In the ages before the turning of the spheres, when the tapestry of existence was first unfurled and the earth, a bounded realm, lay nascent beneath the celestial expanse, there arose within its confines a being known as Olashi Khayyim, a woman burdened with a spirit of profound and unparalleled vexation.

**2.** And it came to pass that Olashi Khayyim harbored a deep and abiding animosity towards her own brother, and this bitter sentiment didst sow the seeds of desolation upon the face of the earth, leading to a great and terrible Obliteration that swept across the land.

**3.** In this desolate dominion, amidst the remnants of what once was, she did dwell, her heart unyielding in its resentment, seeking evermore to amplify the loathing she held for her brother, allowing no tender shoot of reconciliation to find purchase within her breast.

**4.** Yea, she didjourn unto the halls of Durban University of Technology, and even within those precincts of learning, amidst the pursuit of knowledge and understanding, her spirit remained captive to this corrosive disdain, and she didst strive yet further to augment the detestation she felt for her brother.

**5.** Verily, there was naught else that held dominion within her heart save this consuming antipathy for her brother, a relentless fire that knew no quenching and cast its shadow over all her thoughts and deeds.

**6.** Thus is the chronicle of Olashi Khayyim set forth: She didst hold her brother in utter abhorrence, even more than the festering agony of an unhealing boil upon the nethermost regions of the flesh â€“ such was the immeasurable depth of her malevolence.

**7.** Now, behold, her brother, Olama Khayyim, possessed a boundless and everlasting affection for his twin sister, yet her heart remained obdurate, filled with the most grievous and burdensome hatred towards him, and it was this very discord that brought forth the aforementioned obliteration upon the planet earth.

**8.** And she didst seek out further means to inflict pain upon him, wielding her will as a weapon, desiring to demonstrate unto her brother that she esteemed herself as a goddess, capable of commanding the affections of any man upon the earth. Yea, it reached a point where she didst entangle her brother with his newfound companion, one called Hoss, and schemed to ignite within him the flames of jealousy and envy at the prospect of a carnal union between them. Such was the boundless extent of her animosity towards her brother; truly, her malice knew no bounds nor limitations.

**9.** Olashi Khayyim didst choose to bestow her favor upon all manner of beings and things within the world, yet her own twin brother, Olama Khayyim, remained utterly excluded from the compass of her regard.

**10.** And thus, desolation descended upon the planet earth, for Olashi Khayyim, in her profound ignorance, perceived not the truth that this very twin brother whom she so vehemently detested was, in fact, the Almighty God, of most Eternal and Incomprehensible Power and Glory.
