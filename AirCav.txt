### 🛩️ Two Main Branches of Aerospace Engineering

1. Aeronautical Engineering

    Focuses on aircraft that fly within Earth’s atmosphere.
    Examples

      Commercial airplanes (like Boeing or Airbus)
      Military jets
      Helicopters
      Drones

2. Astronautical Engineering

    Focuses on spacecraft and systems that operate outside Earth’s atmosphere.
    Examples

      Satellites
      Rockets (SpaceX, NASA)
      Space stations
      Planetary rovers and probes

### 🧠 What Aerospace Engineers Do

 Area                  Description                                              
 --------------------  -------------------------------------------------------- 
 Flight Mechanics  How things fly (lift, drag, thrust, stability).          
 Propulsion        Jet engines, rocket engines, fuel systems.               
 Structures        Materials and design to handle stress, weight, and heat. 
 Avionics          Electronic systems guidance, navigation, sensors.       
 Control Systems   Making sure aircraftspacecraft behave as expected.      
 Thermodynamics    Heat flow, engine efficiency, atmospheric reentry.
