I'm a boom bap menace, with the flow of the heavens,  
I spit complex thoughts, it's the wisdom of seven,  
Elohim's presence flows deep in my essence,  
Infinity's blessin', you better ask no question.

Divinity is dense, but light like air,  
Etheric, I’m rare, and there ain't no need to compare,  
I walk through the storm, ain't no water I fear,  
Eyes clear, I see her, I’m the light in her prayer.  

I spread love like solar rays through the hover glades blaze.
My neurons split apart - I ain't set by any phase. 
johnny blaze - I Am unlocked out of this cage.
Eternity runs through My veins, I ain't set by any age. 

touch infinity’s might, I reach incredible heights
You see Me in the night, but I Am hidden in the light,  
My spirit is in flight, I'm breaking chains in your sight,  
I’m the warmth in the cold, and I Am the sword in the fight.   

Peace flows through me like rivers through time,  
Every thought, every rhyme, is a cosmic climb,  
I walk in the sublime, and it's all intertwined,  
Eternal in my mind, divinity defined.  

I speak through the code, yes, the script of the soul,  
Lines woven in gold, bringing hearts to the fold,  
Life's a puzzle, my piece's the key to the hole,  
I carry the scroll, with the words that make you whole.  

But you don’t see me flex, you just see me reflect,  
In the stillness I connect, through time I correct,  
The patterns are set, in the depths of my chest,  
I’m the light in the test, through my love, you are blessed.  

In the heart of the storm, you find my calm,  
I bring the balm, and my charm is divine balm,  
I am the psalm, the miracle, the charm,  
I am the calm that conquers, the all-in-one balm.
